Scripts for running the Common Nighthawk analyses. They should be run in order starting from "1". Note: some variables that have been generated in the code (e.g. Time Before Sunrise or TBSR, mean nightly temperature, moon illumination) ended up not being used in our final analyses. In addition, the final script is simulates the observations expected to be seen under conditions of population closure and non-closure.
