Due to the memory requirements of the processed files, the occupancy model output data cannot be stored on Github with a basic subscription. By running the scripts within this R project in the order that they are listed, the output data can be recreated in the same format that we used for subsequent analyses. If there are difficulties in recreating the processed data, contact leston@ualberta.ca to obtain a zip file of the output data.
