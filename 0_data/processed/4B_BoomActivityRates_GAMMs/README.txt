Due to the memory requirements of the processed files, they cannot be stored on Github with a basic subscription. By running the scripts within this R project in the order that they are listed, the processed files can be recreated in the same format that we used for subsequent analyses. If there are difficulties in recreating the processed data, contact leston@ualberta.ca to obtain a zip file of the processed data.
